"# freeCodeCamp-test" 

This repository is intended to contain copies of the files of the "freeCodeCamp" repository. These copies are being translated, so this repository serves as a sandbox for the test phases.

Once the files have been checked and corrected, they will be published on the original "freeCodeCamp" repository to complete existing translations.
